Product promise

A pocket‑ready app for vocalists that captures singing, reveals lyrics in real time, and provides non‑interruptive pronunciation coaching.

Design goals:

Flow-first: never break performance momentum.

Stable feedback: avoid flicker/flapping in live recognition.

One-handed: big controls, minimal steps.

Confidence-aware: show uncertainty without blaming the user.
